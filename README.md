In this first challenge I analyzed financial records of a company and output the following via script in Python:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The results were as follows:

    Financial Analysis
    ----------------------------
    Total Months: 86
    Total: $38382578
    Average  Change: $-2315.12
    Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
    Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

Vote Counting

In this second challenge, I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a script in Python that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

The output was:

    Election Results
    -------------------------
    Total Votes: 3521001
    -------------------------
    Khan: 63.0% (2218231)
    Correy: 20.0% (704200)
    Li: 14.0% (492940)
    O'Tooley: 3.0% (105630)

    Winner: Khan
